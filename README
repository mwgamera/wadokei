不定時法ノ時計

This is an extension for Chrome that adds an icon displaying current
hour as per traditional Japanese time scale used during Edo period.

It adds an icon that displays current hour stem name (zodiac symbol)
in either black or white font (configurable, so it doesn't annoy people
using dark themes).  Hint for that icon is a configurable string that
may contain more details (fraction of hour, numeric name, etc).
Location used in calculations (since futeijihō depends on sunset and
sunrise times) may be configured as well.  Additionally it can ring
a bell in the middle of an hour appropriate number of times.
